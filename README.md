# radioRecorder
Record recurring Internet radio streams to mp3 files according to a schedule. Works on shows produced daily (e.g. every day from 7PM to 8PM) and on shows with a weekly schedule (e.g. every Friday from 7PM to 10PM). It also works for "weekdays" and "weekends".

requires: python-vlc (pip3 install python-vlc). 

I also had to perform a sudo apt-get install vlc on my Ubuntu box even though I had installed vlc from the Ubuntu software store.
